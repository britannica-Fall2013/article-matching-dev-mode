CHABLES QUSTAVUS X. (1622-1660), king of
Sweden, was the son of John Casimir, Elector Palatine of
the Bhine, and of Catherine, daughter of Charles IX of
Sweden. He studied at Upsala, and travelled in France
and'Germany, took part in'the Thirty Years'War, and
fought at Leipsic and elsewhere. On his return to Sweden
he sought the hand of his eccentric cousin, Queen Christina,
whom he professed to love sincerely. Be was rejected;
but in 1654 she voluntarily abdicated the throne, and
was succeeded by him. He had now an opportunity of
gratifying his passion for war. In 1655 he overran Poland,
on the pretext that the king had protested against his
accession and desired to supplant him. The kingdom of
Poland, and after that the dukedom of Prussia, were com-
pelled to swear allegiance to him, and Charles next seized
the continental territory of Denmark. He proposed to
Holland and England a plan for dividing Denmark among
the three nations, but Cromwell scornfully refused to share
in the robbery. Charles was still fighting against Denmark
wheu he died at Gothenburg (1660) ip his 38th year.
