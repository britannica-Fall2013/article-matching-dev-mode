BLOOMFIELD, Robert, was born of very humble
parents at the village of Honington in Suffolk, in 1766.
Losing his father at the age of eleven, he was apprenticed
to a farmer, and could only cultivate his literary tastes by
perusing such books as he could borrow. Thomson seems
to have been his favourite author, and The Seasons inspired
him with the ambition of being a poet. He came to
London, and composed The Farmer's Boy in a garret
in Bell Alley. The manuscript fell into the hands of
Capel Lofft, who encouraged him to print it, and it suc-
ceeded so well, that above 26,000 copies of it were sold.
His reputation was increased by the appearance of his
Rural Tales, Songs and Ballads, News from the Farm,
Wild Flowers, and The Banks of the Wye. These are of
unequal merit; but all breathe a spirit of purity and
enthusiasm for the beauties of nature, that place the name
of Bloomfield among the most natural and amiable of our
pastoral poets. The extensive sale of T/ie Farmer's Boy
and Wild Flowers seems to have done little for the benefit
of the poet, who died in poverty at Shetford in Bedford-
shire in 1823. His Remains in Poetry and Verse, 2 vols.,
appeared in 1824, and another edition of his poems in
1866. A selection from his correspondence, edited by
Hart, appeared in 871.
