SARRAZIN, Jacques (1588-1660), French painter,
born at Noyon in 1588, was a pupil of the father of
Simon Guillain, but he went to Borne at an early age and
worked there under a Frenchman named Anguille. Start-
ing thus, Sarrazin speedily obtained employment from
Cardinal Aldobrandini at Frascati, where he won the
friendship of Domenichino, with whom he afterwards
worked on the high altar of St Andrea della Valle. His
return to Paris, where he married a niece of Simon Vouet's,
was signalized by a series of successes which attracted the
notice of Sublet des Noyers, who entrusted to him the
work by which Sarrazin is best known, the decoration of
the great portal and dome of the western facade of the
interior court of the Louvre. The famous Caryatides of
the attic show, especially in the way in which the shadows
are made to tell as points of support, the profound and
intelligent study of Michelangelo's art to which Sarrazin
had devoted all the time he could spare from bread-
winning whilst in Rome. He now executed many commis-
sions from the queen and from all the chief personages of
the day, devoted much time to painting, a.id was an active
promoter of the foundation of the Academy. The mauso-
leum for the heart of the Prince de Conde in the Jesuit
church of the Rue Saint Antoine was his last considerable
work (see Lenoir, Musee dts Monuments Fmn^ais, v. 5); he
died 3d December 1660, whilst it was in progress, and the
crucifix of the altar was actually completed by one of his
pupils named Gros.
