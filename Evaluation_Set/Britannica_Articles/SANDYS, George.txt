SANDYS, George (1577-1644), famous in the reigns
of James L and Charles I. as a traveller and a metrical
translator. He was born in 1577, the youngest son of an
archbishop of York, studied at St Mary Hall, Oxford, and
afterwards probably at Corpus Christi, and began his travels
in 1610. The record of them was a substantial contribu-
tion to geography and ethnology, written in a style always
interesting and often eloquent, interspersed with versified
scraps of quotations from classical authors. He travelled
from Venice to Constantinople, thence to Egypt, thencn
by way of Mount Sinai to Palestine, and back to Venice
by way of Cyprus, Sicily, Naples, and Rome. Later on
in his lifo he published translations of Ovid's Metamor-
phoses, the first book of the J2neid, and various books of
Scripture. His verso was praised by Dryden, and de-
servedly so, for it has vitality as well as a clearly marked
rhythm. He died in 1644. Selections from his poetry
were published by the Rev. H. J. Todd in 1839.
