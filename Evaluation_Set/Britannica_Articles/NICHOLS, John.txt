NICHOLS, John (1745-1826), a printer, ranks among
the most industrious and voluminous of English antiquaries
and collectors. He was editor of the Genllcman't ilagcmne
for nearly half a century, from 1778 till his death, and,
partly in his magazine and partly in his numerous volumes
of A ntcdotn and Illtutratiotu, made invaluable contributions
to the personal history of English men of letters in the
18th century. The project of compiling these volumes
grew gradually out of his business as a printer. Born in
London in 1745, he had been the apprentice and successor
of Bowyer, a learned and accomplished printer, a graduate
of Cambridge, who had printed for many distinguished
men; and on the death of this revered master, in 1778, he
issued a brief memoir. This he afterwards expanded into
biographical and literary anecdotes of Mr Bowyer and his
friends; and, materials accumulating upon him, he
expanded his design into a sort of anecdotical literary
history of the century, many important letters being
placed at his disposal. Large as this work is, it formed
but a small part of the indefatigable collector's activity, of
which a full account is given in a memoir by Chalmers
accompanying the extension of the JUwtrationt by
Mr J. B. Nichols. One of his favourite works was an
antiquarian history of the town and county of Leicester;
and another, on which he himself set great value, a collec-
tion of documents illustrating the manners and expenses of
ancient times in England. He produced six volumes
concerning the progresses, processions, and festivities of
Elizabeth and James. In the days of his apprenticeship
he wrote and published two volumes of poetry, but had
the good sense to throw his genial energies afterwards into
other channels, Vol, xcvL of the Qtnllmam'* iiaga***
