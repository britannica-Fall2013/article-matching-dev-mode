SANDERSON, Robert (1587-1663), bishop of Lin-
coln, and one of the worthies celebrated by Izaak Walton,
was born at Rotherham, Yorkshire, in 1587. Ho was edu-
cated at the grammar school of his native town and at
Lincoln College, Oxford, took orders in 1611, and was
promoted successively to several benefices. On the recom-
mendation of Laud he was appointed one of the royal
chaplains inl631, and as a preacher was a great favourite
with the king. In 1612 Charles created him regius pro-
fessor of divinity at Oxford, with a canonry of Christ
Church annexed. But the civil war prevented him until
1646 from entering on the office; and in 1648 he was
ejected by the visitors whom the parliament had com-
missioned. He recovered these preferments at the Restora-
tion, and was promoted to the bishopric of Lincoln, but
lived only two years to enjoy his new dignities, dying in
his seventy-sixth year in 1663. His most celebrated work
is his Cases of Conscience, deliberate j udgments upon points
of morality submitted to him. Some of these cases, notably
that of Sabbath observance, and that of signing the "En-
gagement" to the Commonwealth, were printed surrepti-
tiously during his lifetime, though drawn up in answer
to private spiritual clients; and a collection, gradually
enlarged in sucexJsoive editions, was published after his
death'. They are extremely interesting specimens of
English casuistry, distinguished not less by moral integrity
than good sense, learning, and close, comprehensive, and
subtle reasoning. His practice as a college lecturer in
logic is better evidenced by these "cases" than by his
Compendium of Logic published in 1615. A complete
edition of Sanderson's works was edited by Dr Jacobson in
1854 (Oxford Press). To this the reader may be referred




for his sermons and his occasional tracts on public affairi
during the troubled period of his middlo life and old age.
