school near London to obtain an education preparing him
for commercial pursuits. In 1744 he became a clerk in
the East India Company's service in Calcutta. In 1752
he went to Madras, and in the following year he returned
home with Lord Clive, with whom he lived on terms of
clone intimacy. His knowledge of Indian affairs gave him
considerable influence with the company. Returning to
Madras in 1755, he was appointed a member of the council,
and in this position took an active part in directing the
military operations in the Carnatic in 1755-59. By the
court of directors he was appointed to succeed Lord Figot
in the government of Madras, and in 1757-59 he was
commissary-general. In the latter year bad health com-

London, where he occupied himself in writing a History
of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indo-

ness to certain portions of his narrative it produces on the whole

In 1782 Orme also published Historical Fragments of the Mogul
Empire from the year 1659, and in 1805 this was reprinted and
published along with two other treatises, The Origin of the English
Establishment and, A General Idea of the Government and People of
Hindoslon, and preceded by a short L\fe of the author. He be-
queathed several hundred volumes of manuscript collections, and a
number of scarco tracts on Oriental subjects, to the library of ths
East India Company.
