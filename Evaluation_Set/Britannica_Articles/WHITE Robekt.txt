WHITE Robekt (1645-1704), engraver and draughts-
man, was born in London in 1645. Ho studied engraving
under David Loggan, for whom he executed many architec-
tural subjects; his early works also include landscapes
and engraved title-pages for books. He acquired great
skill in portraiture, his works of this class being commonly
drawn with the black-lead pencil upon vellum, and after-
wards excellently engraved in line. Portraits executed in
this manner he marked " ad vivum," and they are prized
by collectors for their artistic merit and their authenticity.
Virtue catalogued 275 portrait engravings by White, in-
cluding the likenesses of many of the most celebrated per-
sonages of his day; and nine portraits engraved in mezzo-
tint are assigned to him by J. Chaloner Smith. White
died at Bloomsbury, London, in 1704.


His son, George White, who was born about 1671 and died about
1734, is also known as an engraver and portrait-painter.
