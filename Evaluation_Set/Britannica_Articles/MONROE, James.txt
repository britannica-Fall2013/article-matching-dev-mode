MONROE, James (1758-1831), fifth president of the
United States, was born 28th April 1758, in the county
of Westmoreland, Virginia. According to the family
tradition, their ancestors are traced back to a family of




Scottish cavaliers descended from Hector Monroe, an officer
of Charles I. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary war,
James Monroe was a student at the College of William and
Mary, but left his studies in 1776 to join the continental
army. He took part as lieutenant in the New Jersey
campaign of that year, and was wounded at the battle of
Trenton. The next year he served with the rank of captain
on the staff of General William Alexander ("Lord Stirling"),
but, thus being out of the line of promotion, he soon found
himself without military employment- In 1780 he began
the study of the law under the direction of Jefferson, then
governor of Virginia. His intimacy with Jefferson at this
time had probably a controlling influence upon his subse-
quent political career. He continued through all vicissitudes
to possess the friendship and support of both Jefferson and
Madison.


In 1782 Monroe was in the State legislature, and from
1783 to 1786 was a member of Congress. On retiring
from Congress he entered upon the practice of the law at
Fredericksburg, and was again elected to the legislature.
In the Virginia convention of 1788 for the ratification of
the constitution, he was among the opponents of that
instrument; but his course was approved by the legisla-
ture of his State, who elected him United States senator
in 1790 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William
Grayson. As senator he was a decided opponent of the
Federalist administration. Nevertheless he was selected
by Washington in 1794 as minister to France in place of
Gouverneur Morris, a Federalist, recalled upon the request
of the French Government. Being of the party who sym-
pathized with the revolutionary struggle in France, it was
expected that his appointment would be flattering to the
Government of that country, and would also conciliate the
French party at home. The Government of the National Con-
vention received Monroe with open signs of favour, and on
his part he expressed his own and his country's sympathy
with the French Republic with so much enthusiasm that
Washington deemed his language not in keeping with the
neutral policy which the administration had recently pro-
claimed. At about the same time John Jay had negotiated
a treaty of amity and commerce with England which gave
great umbrage to France. It was alleged that the earlier
treaty of 1778 with France was violated by the stipulations
of the Jay treaty; and the Directory seemed disposed to
make of this a casus belli. In this emergency it was
believed by Washington and his advisers that Monroe
failed to represent properly the policy of the Government,
and he was therefore recalled in 1796. In justification of
his diplomatic conduct, he published the next year his
View, a pamphlet of 500 pages. In 1799 he became
governor of Virginia, and was twice re-elected. In the
meantime the Republican party had come into power, with
Jefferson as president, and Monroe was again called upon
to fill an important diplomatic station. He was com-
missioned on 10th January 1803 to act with Livingston,
resident minister at Paris, in negotiating the purchase of
New Orleans and the territory embracing the mouth of
the Mississippi, which formed a part of the province of
Louisiana, recently ceded by Spain to France. In view of
the anticipated renewal of hostilities between England and
France in 1803, Napoleon was anxious, for a consideration,
to part with his new acquisition, which in the event of a
war with England he would probably lose by conquest.
The American commissioners met therefore with little
difficulty in the accomplishment of their object. But, in
the absence of instructions, they assumed the responsibility
of negotiating the purchase not only of New Orleans but
of the entire territory of Louisiana—an event that is hardly
second in importance to any in the history of the country.

to succeed Rufus King, who had resigned. In 1804 he
undertook a mission to Madrid, with the object of
negotiating the purchase of the Floridas; but in this he
was unsuccessful, and returned to London in 1805. The
next year he was joined in a commission with William
Pinkney to negotiate a treaty with England to take the
place of the Jay treaty, which expired in that year.
Lords Auckland and Howick having been appointed on the
part of England, a treaty was concluded on the last day
of the year, which was perhaps more favourable to the
United States than the Jay treaty; but, like the latter, it
contained no provision against the impressment of Ameri-
can seamen. For this reason President Jefferson refused
to submit it to the Senate for ratification, but sent it back
for revision. In the meantime Canning had become
foreign secretary in place of Fox, and refused to re-
open the negotiation. Monroe returned to the United
States in 1807, and, as in the case of his first French
mission, he drew up a defence of his diplomatic conduct
in England. In 1808 certain disaffected Republicans
attempted to put Monroe forward as the candidate for the
presidency, but as Virginia declared in favour of Madison
Monroe withdrew his name. In 1810 he was again in
the legislature of his native State, and the next year its
governor. But in this year he was called from the state
to the national councils, superseding Robert Smith as
secretary of state in Madison's cabinet, and took an
active part in precipitating the war against England in
1812. On the retirement of Armstrong, after the capture
of Washington in 1814, Monroe assumed the duties of the
war department in addition to those of the state depart-
ment, and by his energy and decision infused something
of vigour into the conduct of the war. He was elected
president in 1816, and was re-elected in 1820 without
opposition. The period of his administration (1817-25)
has been called "the era of good feeling," for the reason
that the party issues of the past were mostly dead, and
new issues had not yet arisen. In the formation of
his cabinet Monroe showed the soundness of his judg-
ment, selecting for the leading positions J. Q. Adams,
J. C. Calhoun, W. H. Crawford, and William Wirt. With
these able advisers he devoted himself to the economic
development of the country, which had been so long
retarded by foreign complications. As president, more-
over, he was able to accomplish in 1819 the acquisi-
tion of the Floridas, which as minister to Spain he had
failed to do in 1804, and to define the boundary of Louis-
iana, which he had been the agent in purchasing in 1803.
But Monroe is best known to later generations as the
author of the so-called "Monroe doctrine," a declaration
inserted in his seventh annual message, 2d December 1823.
It was the formulation of the sentiment, then beginning
to prevail, that America was for Americans. One of the
principles of the neutral policy of the country, which had
been established with much difficulty, had been that the
United States would not interfere in European politics;
and now this policy was held to include the converse as a
necessary corollary—that is, that Europe should not inter-
fere in American politics,whether in North Americaor South
America. The occasion of proclaiming this doctrine was
the rumoured intervention of the Hoi}- Alliance to aid Spain
in the reconquest of her American colonies. President
Monroe believed that such a policy entered upon by the
allied continental powers of Europe would be dangerous
to the peace and safety of the United States; he therefore
declared that "we would not view any intervention for
the purpose of oppressing them (the Spanish American
states) or controlling in any manner their destiny, by any
European power, in any other light than a.s the manifesta-
tion of an unfriendly disposition towards the United




States." This declaration, together with the known hos-
tility of England to such a project, was sufficient to prevent
further action on the part of the Alliance.


On the expiration of his presidential term Monroe re-
tired to Oak Hill, his residence in London county, Vir-
ginia; but at the time of his death, 4th July 1831, he was
residing in New York. He was married about 1786, and
left two daughters. He was a man of spotless character;
and, though not possessing ability of the first order, he
ranks high as a wise and prudent statesman. His Life
has been written by D. C. Oilman. (f. sn.)
