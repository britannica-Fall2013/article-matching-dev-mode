REMUSAT, Abel (1788-1832), a distinguished
Chinese schokv, was born at Paris, 5th September 1788.
His father, a surgeon, superintended his early education in
person and designed him for the medical profession. Jean
Piene Abel Remusat graduated with distinction as M.D.
in 1813, and for a short time held a hospital appointment,
but his heart had long been in other studies. A Chinese
herbal in the collection of the Abbe Tersan had attracted
his attention when he was still a lad; he taught himself to
read by great perseverance and with very imperfect helps,
and at the end of five years' study he produced in 1811 an
Essai mr la langiu et la literature Chinoites, and a paper
on foreign languages among the Chinese, which procured
him the patronage of De Sacy. In 1814 a chair of Chinese
was founded at the CoLege de France, and Remusat was
placed in it. From this time he gave himself wholly to
the languages of tho Extreme East, and published a long
series of useful works, among which his contribut' jns from
Chinese sources to the history of the Tartar nations claim
special notice. Remusat became an editor of the Journal
de Savants in 1818, and founder and first secretary of the
Paris Asiatic Society in 1822; he held also in the course
of his life various honourable and lucrative Government
appointments. He married in 1830, but had no children.
He died at Paris, 4th June 1832, and his ilogt was written
by De Sacy.
