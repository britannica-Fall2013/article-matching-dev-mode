WINTHROP, John (1587-1649), was bom at Groton,
Suffolk, England, January 12, 1587. He graduated st
Trinity College, Cambridge, about 1605, and was bred to
the law. He became a Puritan, and id 1629 was made
governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company. The next
year he headed the great emigration to Massachusetts,
landing at Salem and settling at Boston. The remainder
of his life was closely identified with the history of his
colony. He was re-elected governor until 1634, and
afterwards in 1637-40, 1641-43, and 1646-49. He died
at Boston, March 26, 1649.


The tenderness snd gentleness of Winthrop's nature are beyond
dispute; even such political opponents as Vane retained their
personal friendship for him. These qualities, however, vers sup-
plemented by a decided antipathy to democracy in every form,
which made nim the best of civil leaders for the supporters of the
ecclesiastical system of early Massachusetts. A vigorous, perhaps
captious, statement of this side of his influence will be- found is
Brooks Adams's Emancipation of Massachusetts. His Lift and
Letters have been edited by his descendant, R. C Winthrop. Bis
Journal has been edited by James Savage, who has given it the
more appropriate and exact title of The History of Neu> England,
1630-1649. The Winthrop Papers are in the Collections of the
Massachusetts Historical Society. Winthrop's descendants have
been numerous, snd have included an unusual number of men and
women of marked ability; 'see Whitmore's Notes on the Winthrop
Family. One of them, Theodore Winthrop (1828-1861), of Hew
Haven, was one of the earliest victims of the civil war.
