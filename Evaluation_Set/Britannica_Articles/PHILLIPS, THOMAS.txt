PHILLIPS, THOMAS (1770-1845), portrait and subject
painter, was born at Dudley in Warwickshire on 18th
October 1770. Having acquired the art of glass-painting
at Birmingham, he visited London in 1790 with an intro-





duction to Benjamin Wejrt, who found him employment on
the windows in St George's chapel at Windsor. In 1792
Phillips painted a view of Windsor Castle, and ere the two
succeeding years had passed he exhibited the Death of
Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, at the Battle of Oastillon,
Ruth and Naomi, Elijah restoring the Widow's Son,
Cupid disarmed by Euphrosyne, and other pictures of that
class. From the year 1796, however, he seems to have
mainly confined himself to portrait-painting; and it was
in this walk that he was destined to acquire his reputa-
tion as an artist. It was not long before he became the
chosen painter of men of genius and talent, notwithstand-
ing the rivalry of Hoppner, Owen, Jackson, and Lawrence;
and he has left behind him portraits of nearly all the
illustrious characters of his day. His works of this kind
are distinguished by simplicity, careful and finished hand-
ling, and truth of portraiture, but in colour they are com-
monly cold and feeble. In 1804 he was elected associate
and four years later member of the Royal Academy. In
1824 Phillips succeeded Fuseli as professor of painting to
the Royal Academy, an office which he held till 1832.
During this period he delivered ten Lectura on the History
and Principie» of Painting, which were published in 1833.
He likewise wrote a Urge number of the articles on the
fine arts in Rees's Cyclopedia. He died on the 20th of
April 1846.
