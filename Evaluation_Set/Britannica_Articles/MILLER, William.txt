MILLER, William (1781-1849), the founder of an
American religious sect holding peculiar millennarian views,
was born at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 1781. He received
¦a very imperfect education. In the war of 1812 he served
as captain of volunteers on the Canadian frontier. While
Tesidingat Low Hampton, N.Y., he began in 1833 publicly
to lecture on the subject of the millennium, asserting that
the second coining of Christ would take place in about
ten years. His doctrines awakened wide interest among
certain classes of the community. In 18-10 a semi-monthly
journal, The Signs of the Time.*, was started by one of his
followers, and two years later the Advent Herald made its
appearance. About 18-13 the second coming of Christ was
expected by as many as 50,000 believers in the doctrines of




Miller; and, although the disappointment of their hopes
somewhat diminished their numbers, many continued their
adherence to his tenets regarding the nature of the millen-
nium. At present the number of Millerites or Adventists is
estimated at from 15,000 to 20,000. Miller died at New
Hampton, Washington county, N.Y., December 20, 1849.
